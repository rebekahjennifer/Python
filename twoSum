Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        h = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            n = target - num
            if n not in h:
                h[num] = i
                
            else:
                return [h[n],i]
